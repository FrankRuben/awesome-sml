# Implementations

- [SML/NJ (Standard ML of New Jersey)](http://www.smlnj.org/): the canonical SML compiler
- [MLton](http://mlton.org/): very advanced whole-program optimizing compiler
- [Poly/ML](https://polyml.org): good compiler with threads and concurrent GC
- [CakeML](https://cakeml.org/): verified self-hosting subset of SML
- [Alice ML](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice/): SML with extensions for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming
- [Moscow ML](https://mosml.org/): lightweight compiler and interpreter
- [HaMLet](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/): self-hosting SML interpreter written entirely in SML
- [MLKit](https://elsman.com/mlkit/): new compiler with versatile GC
- [SMLtoJs](http://web.archive.org/web/20181130122359/http://www.smlserver.org/smltojs/): SML-to-JavaScript transpiler

# Standard libraries (de jure and de facto)

- [Standard ML Basis Library](http://sml-family.org/Basis/)
- [Concurrent ML](http://cml.cs.uchicago.edu)
- [SML/NJ library](https://www.smlnj.org/doc/smlnj-lib/) also ships with MLton

# Extra Libraries
