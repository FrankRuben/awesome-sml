- [MLton](http://mlton.org/): very advanced whole-program optimizing compiler
  - [MaPLe](https://github.com/MPLLang): fork-join parallelism extension for MLton
- [Poly/ML](https://polyml.org): good compiler with threads and concurrent GC
- [CakeML](https://cakeml.org/): verified self-hosting subset of SML
- [Alice ML](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice/): SML with extensions for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming
- [Moscow ML](https://mosml.org/): lightweight compiler and interpreter
- [HaMLet](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/): self-hosting SML interpreter written entirely in SML
- [MLKit](https://elsman.com/mlkit/): new compiler with versatile GC
- [SML#](https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/): new compiler with practical language extensions
- [SMLtoJs](http://web.archive.org/web/20181130122359/http://www.smlserver.org/smltojs/): SML-to-JavaScript transpiler

# Standard libraries (de jure and de facto)
